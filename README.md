## About Me

Hey there! My name is Joona, and I'm a 3rd-year Information Technology student at Vaasa University of Applied Sciences, majoring in software development. I'm passionate about everything technology-related, with a strong interest in UI/UX and design as well.
You should also check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/joonajs) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/joonajs). Also I got my personal site at [joona.studio](https://joona.studio) and [hey.joona.studio](https://hey.joona.studio/) so feel free to check them out as well! ðŸ‘·

## Projects

Hereâ€™s a small list of some projects Iâ€™ve worked on, this will be updated in the future:

### [Magic Bin](https://github.com/joonajs/magic-bin)
Magic Bin was made as the final project for my React development course. It allows users to store a 1000-character text snippet in a "bin" and generates a unique token to share and retrieve the text with others.

### [Sorter](https://github.com/joonajs/sorter)
A straightforward web app that helps users organize text documents by sorting their content alphabetically.

### [XTemps](https://github.com/joonajs/xtemps)
XTemps is a temporary file server built for quick file sharing. It combines a Flask backend with a React frontend, allowing users to spin up a local server for ephemeral file transfers.

### [HRMA](https://gitlab.com/joonajs/hrma)
The Hotel Room Management Application (HRMA) lets users log in, sign up, and book hotel rooms. It was made for a DevOps course as a final project, focusing on CI/CD and Docker.

## Design

As much as I love developing software and programming, I also have a passion for design. I have experience in creating user interfaces and user experiences for web applications, mobile applications, and websites. I have a strong understanding of design principles and I always strive to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.
